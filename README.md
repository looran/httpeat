**httpeat is a recursive, parallel and multi-mirror/multi-proxy HTTP downloader**

Features:
- parses HTTP index pages and HTTP URLs list, provided as arguments or from text file
- **recursive and parallel crawling** of index pages
- **download in parallel** multiple URLs, with configurable tasks count
- **fast interrupt and resume** mechanism, even on hundreds of thousands files directories as it remembers where indexing and downloads were interrupted
- **robust retry** and resumes transfers automatically
- supports downloading **in parallel from multiple mirrors**
- supports downloading **in parallel from multiple proxies**

httpeat v0.2 - recursive, parallel and multi-mirror/multi-proxy HTTP downloader

positional arguments:
  session_name          name of the session
  targets               to create a session, provide URLs to HTTP index or files, or path of a source txt file

  -m MIRROR, --mirror MIRROR
                        mirror definition to load balance requests, eg. "http://host1/data/ mirrors http://host2/data/"
                        can be specified multiple times.
                        only valid uppon session creation, afterwards you must modify session mirrors.txt.
  -P, --no-progress     disable progress bar
  -q, --quiet           quiet output, show only warnings
  -s SKIP, --skip SKIP  skip rule: dl-(path|size-gt):[pattern]. can be specified multiple times.

                        in seconds, default to {TO_DEFAULT}
  -T, --no-index-touch  do not create empty .download files uppon indexing
  -v, --verbose         verbose output, specify twice for http request debug
  -w WAIT, --wait WAIT  wait after request for n to n*3 seconds, for each task
  -x PROXY, --proxy PROXY
                        proxy URL: "(http[s]|socks5)://<host>:<port>[ tasks-count=N]"
                        can be specified multiple times to loadbalance downloads between proxies.
                        optional tasks-count overrides the golbal tasks-count.
                        only valid uppon session creation, afterwards you must modify session proxies.txt.
  -z TASKS_COUNT, --tasks-count TASKS_COUNT
                        number of parallel tasks, defaults to 3
```

## session directory structure
```
<session_name>/
   log.txt
   state_download.csv
   state_index.csv
   targets.txt
   mirrors.txt
   proxies.txt
   data/
      ...downloaded files...
```

## Example usage

- crawl HTTP index page and linked files
```
httpeat antennes https://ferme.ydns.eu/antennes/bands/2024-10/
```

- resume after interrupt
```
httpeat antennes
```

- crawl HTTP index page, using mirror from host2
```
httpeat bigfilesA https://host1/data/ -m "https://host2/data/ mirrors https://host1/data/"
```

- crawl HTTP index page, using 2 proxies
```
httpeat bigfilesB https://host1/data/ -x "socks4://192.168.0.2:3000" -x "socks4://192.168.0.3:3000"
```

- crawl 2 HTTP index directory pages
```
httpeat bigfilesC https://host1/data/one/ https://host1/data/six/
```

- download 3 files
```
httpeat bigfilesD https://host1/data/bigA.iso https://host1/data/six/bigB.iso https://host1/otherdata/bigC.iso
```

- download 3 files with URLs from txt file
```
cat <<-_EOF > ./list.txt
https://host1/data/bigA.iso
https://host1/data/six/bigB.iso
https://host1/otherdata/bigC.iso
_EOF
httpeat bigfilesE ./list.txt
```

# Installation

```
pip install httpeat
```

# Limitations

files count:
- above approximalety 1 000 000 files in the download queue, httpeat will start to eat your CPU.

live progress:
- showing live progress eats CPU, even if we throtle it to 0.5 frames per second. if it is too much for you, use -P / --no-progress.
- showing live progress while activating verbose messages with -v / --verbose may eat a lot of CPU, since the 'rich' library needs to process all the logs. try using -P / --no-progress when activating verbose logs.

# Change log / todo list

```
v0.1
- while downloading store <file>.download, then rename when done
- improve index parser capability to handle unknown pages
- test that the URL "unquote" to path works, in dowload mode
- accept text file URL list as argument, also useful for testing
- store local files with full URL path including host
- existing session do not need URL of file list. prepare for "download from multiple hosts"
- retry immediatly on download error
  see "Retrying HTTPX Requests" https://scrapfly.io/blog/web-scraping-with-python-httpx/
  for testing see https://github.com/Colin-b/pytest_httpx
- retry count per entry, then drop it and mark as error
- keep old states, in case last ones get corrupted
- maybe log file with higher log level and timestamp ? or at least time for start and end ? (last option implemented)
- prevent SIGINT during CSV state file saving

v0.2
- hide begining of URL on info print when single root prefix is identified
- unit tests for network errors
- fix progress update of indexer in download-only mode: store progress and it's task id in State_*
  and update in indexer/downloader
- argument to skip gt size
- fix modification date of downloaded files when doing final mv. don't fix directories for now
- add rich line for current file of each download task: name, size, retry count
- progress download bar should show size, and file count as additional numbers
- progress bar should be black and white
- progress bars should  display bytes per second for download
- display file path instead of URL after download completed
- display file size after path after download completed
- handle file names len > 255
- create all .download empty files during indexing, option to disable
- download from multiple (2?) mirrors

- fix handling of SIGTERM, by dedirecing raising SIGINT
- fix show 'index' line all the time, even if nothing to do
- fix dl/idx progress bar position to match dl workers
